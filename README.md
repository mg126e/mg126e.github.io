Quick local test
1. Open `index.html` in a browser (double-click or use a static file server).
2. To test a simple Python static server (if you have Python installed), run:

```powershell
python -m http.server 8000; start http://localhost:8000
```

Want me to customize the content (projects, about text, images)? Reply with what text and images to include and I will update `index.html` for you.
